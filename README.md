# Smart_IoT_Temperature_System
The "Smart IoT Temperature Monitoring System with Blynk" project is a dynamic exploration of IoT technology, combining the power of sensors, microcontrollers, and the Blynk platform to create an intelligent temperature monitoring and control system.
I used the DHT11 Temperature Sensor, Esp8266, and a Blynk cloud platform for this project.
A setpoint temperature is saved in the microcontroller, when the setpoint exceeds, an Alarm system which is an LED Bulb and an Alarm Buzzer system activates, but if the limit is exceeded to a very high level then an auto cooling system (Fan in this case) is activated to bring the temperature down, and this all is being displayed on a dashboard of Blynk cloud which can be accessed by the operator. 
Also, emails and mobile notifications can be sent to the operator so that he could be able to take safety measures.
